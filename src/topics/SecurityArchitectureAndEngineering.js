      "answer": "A document that links an organization's security requirements to the controls and mechanisms implemented to meet those requirements"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a threat modeling process?",
      "answer": "A process for identifying and analyzing potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system or application, and implementing appropriate controls to mitigate or reduce the risk"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security design pattern?",
      "answer": "A proven, repeatable solution to a common security problem or challenge, often used in the design and implementation of secure systems and applications"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security test and evaluation (ST&E) process?",
      "answer": "A process for assessing the effectiveness and adequacy of security controls and mechanisms within an organization's systems, applications, and infrastructure"

      "question": "What is a security control framework?",
      "answer": "A structured and comprehensive set of guidelines and controls for implementing and managing security within an organization"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Defense in Depth (DiD) principle?",
      "answer": "The practice of implementing multiple layers of security controls and mechanisms to provide overlapping and redundant protection against security threats and vulnerabilities"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security reference architecture?",
      "answer": "A documented architecture that defines the high-level design and components of an organization's security infrastructure and controls"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security architecture review?",
      "answer": "A process for evaluating the effectiveness and adequacy of an organization's security architecture and controls, often conducted by an independent third-party auditor or assessor"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security requirements specification?",
      "answer": "A security requirements specification is a document that outlines an organization's security needs and expectations for its systems. It serves as a foundation for security engineering and architecture, providing guidelines for the design, development, and implementation of secure systems."
	  },
    {
      "question": "What is a security technology architecture?",
      "answer": "A documented architecture that defines the technical components and configurations of an organization's security infrastructure and controls"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security service level agreement (SLA)?",
      "answer": "A contractual agreement between an organization and a third-party provider that defines the levels of security service and support to be provided, typically including performance metrics and penalties for noncompliance"
