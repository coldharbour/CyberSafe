      "question": "What is a payload?",
      "answer": "The code or data that an attacker delivers or executes on a target system or network, typically with the goal of gaining unauthorized access or control"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a honeypot?",
      "answer": "A decoy system or network designed to lure attackers into revealing their methods or intentions, while allowing defenders to study and respond to the attack"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability scanner?",
      "answer": "A software tool or service that scans a system or network for known vulnerabilities or weaknesses, typically using a database of known vulnerabilities"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a vulnerability and an exploit?",
      "answer": "A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system or application, while an exploit is a technique or code that takes advantage of that weakness to compromise the system or application"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is port scanning?",
      "answer": "The process of scanning a system or network for open ports, typically using software tools, in order to identify potential attack vectors"
    },

      "question": "What is reverse engineering?",
      "answer": "The process of deconstructing and analyzing software or hardware in order to understand its design, functionality, and vulnerabilities"
    },
  {
      "question": "What is a buffer overflow?",
      "answer": "A type of vulnerability where an attacker can send more data than a program is expecting, causing it to overwrite adjacent memory or execute arbitrary code"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a brute-force attack?",
      "answer": "An attack method that involves trying all possible passwords or combinations until the correct one is found, typically using automated software tools"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an SQL injection attack?",
      "answer": "A type of attack that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in SQL databases or applications, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands or access sensitive data"
