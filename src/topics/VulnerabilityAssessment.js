    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a vulnerability scan and a vulnerability assessment?",
      "answer": "A vulnerability scan is an automated tool or service that scans a system or application for known vulnerabilities, while a vulnerability assessment is a more comprehensive process that includes manual testing and analysis"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a penetration test?",
      "answer": "A simulated cyber attack on a system or application to identify and exploit vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of security controls"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability database?",
      "answer": "A collection of known vulnerabilities and associated information, used to identify and prioritize security issues in a system or application"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)?",
      "answer": "A standardized system for assessing and rating the severity of security vulnerabilities, based on factors such as the potential impact and ease of exploitation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability management program?",
      "answer": "A structured approach to identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in a system or application"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability remediation plan?",
      "answer": "A plan for addressing and mitigating security vulnerabilities, typically including timelines, responsibilities, and priorities"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability scanner?",
      "answer": "An automated tool or service that scans a system or application for known vulnerabilities, typically using a database of known issues and attack patterns"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network vulnerability assessment?",
      "answer": "The process of identifying and evaluating security vulnerabilities in a network infrastructure, typically including devices, applications, and protocols"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a web application vulnerability assessment?",
      "answer": "The process of identifying and evaluating security vulnerabilities in a web application, typically including issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and authentication weaknesses"
    },   {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability scanner policy?",
      "answer": "A set of rules and parameters used to configure a vulnerability scanner, typically including scan frequency, target systems or applications, and scan depth"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a false positive in vulnerability assessment?",
      "answer": "A result of a vulnerability scan that is identified as a vulnerability, but is actually a benign or intentional feature of the system or application"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a false negative in vulnerability assessment?",
      "answer": "A result of a vulnerability scan that fails to identify a real security vulnerability"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an unauthenticated vulnerability scan?",
      "answer": "A vulnerability scan that does not require authentication or access credentials, typically used to identify external-facing vulnerabilities"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an authenticated vulnerability scan?",
      "answer": "A vulnerability scan that requires authentication or access credentials, typically used to identify internal vulnerabilities and misconfigurations"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a port scanner?",
      "answer": "An automated tool or service that scans a network for open ports and services, often used as a preliminary step in vulnerability scanning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability disclosure?",
      "answer": "The process of reporting a security vulnerability to the responsible party, typically including technical details and recommendations for mitigation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is vulnerability chaining?",
      "answer": "The process of combining multiple vulnerabilities to achieve a more significant compromise of a system or application"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability exploit?",
      "answer": "A technique or tool used to exploit a security vulnerability, typically to gain unauthorized access or cause system disruption"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a vulnerability scanner appliance?",
      "answer": "A dedicated hardware or virtual appliance used for vulnerability scanning, typically providing greater scalability and performance than software-based scanners"
