      "question": "What is a one-way function in cryptography?",
      "answer": "A mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction, but computationally infeasible to compute in the opposite direction"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a digital envelope?",
      "answer": "A method of encrypting a message with a symmetric key, which is then encrypted with the recipient's public key and sent along with the message"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a nonce?",
      "answer": "A random number used once in a cryptographic protocol to prevent replay attacks and improve security"
    },

  {
      "question": "What is a substitution cipher?",
      "answer": "A type of cipher that replaces one character or symbol with another, often using a fixed pattern or key"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a transposition cipher?",
      "answer": "A type of cipher that rearranges the order of characters or symbols in a message, often using a fixed pattern or key"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC)?",
      "answer": "A technique that combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to create a message authentication code that can verify the authenticity and integrity of a message"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key length in cryptography?",
      "answer": "The size of a cryptographic key, typically measured in bits, that determines the complexity and security of an encryption algorithm"
