      "question": "What is the OWASP Top Ten?",
      "answer": "A list of the most critical web application security risks identified by the Open Web Application Security Project, including injection attacks, broken authentication, and insufficient logging and monitoring"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a secure software development life cycle (SDLC)?",
      "answer": "A process for integrating security into the software development process, typically involving security requirements, threat modeling, security testing, and security reviews"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is threat modeling?",
      "answer": "A process for identifying and analyzing potential threats to an application, system, or network, and determining appropriate security controls to mitigate those threats"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?",
      "answer": "Vulnerability scanning is the process of scanning a system or application for known vulnerabilities, while penetration testing is the process of simulating an attack to identify and exploit vulnerabilities"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a web application firewall (WAF)?",
      "answer": "A security control that filters and blocks malicious traffic to a web application, based on predefined rules and policies"
    },

      "question": "What is secure coding?",
      "answer": "The practice of writing software code that is resistant to vulnerabilities and exploits, by adhering to secure coding standards and best practices"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is input validation?",
      "answer": "The process of verifying and sanitizing user input to prevent injection attacks and other types of exploits"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of code reviews in application security?",
      "answer": "To review and analyze application code for security vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and adherence to secure coding practices"
    },
   {
      "question": "What is a security control?",
      "answer": "A measure or mechanism used to reduce the risk of security incidents and breaches, such as access controls, encryption, and monitoring"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the principle of least privilege?",
      "answer": "The practice of granting users and systems only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their authorized tasks, to reduce the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?",
      "answer": "A type of web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page, typically via a script or other executable code"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is SQL injection?",
      "answer": "A type of web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute SQL queries on a database, typically by injecting malicious SQL code into a web form or URL parameter"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?",
      "answer": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a web vulnerability that enables attackers to perform unauthorized actions on a victim's behalf by exploiting their trusted relationship with a website. Attackers trick victims into executing malicious requests, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data theft."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the principle of defense in depth?",
      "answer": "The practice of implementing multiple layers of security controls to protect against a variety of threats and attack vectors"

      "question": "What is a buffer overflow?",
      "answer": "A type of software vulnerability that occurs when a program writes data outside the bounds of a buffer or memory space, typically leading to a crash or code execution"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between white box and black box testing?",
      "answer": "White box testing involves testing a system with full knowledge of its internal structure and code, while black box testing involves testing a system with no knowledge of its internal workings"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a threat agent?",
      "answer": "An entity or force that is capable of exploiting a vulnerability or initiating an attack, such as a hacker, malware, or natural disaster"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security requirement?",
      "answer": "A specification or expectation for the security of a system or application, typically based on policies, standards, or regulations"
