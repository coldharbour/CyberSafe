    {
      "question": "What is a proxy server?",
      "answer": "A server that acts as an intermediary between a device and the Internet, forwarding requests and filtering or caching data to improve performance and security"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network topology?",
      "answer": "The physical or logical arrangement of devices, cables, and other components in a network, defining how data flows between them"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network protocol?",
      "answer": "A set of rules and standards that govern the communication and exchange of data between network devices and systems"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a hub and a switch?",
      "answer": "A hub broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices, while a switch forwards data only to the intended recipient, improving network efficiency and security"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of a network load balancer?",
      "answer": "To distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources, ensuring better performance, scalability, and availability"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is network virtualization?",
      "answer": "A technique that enables the creation of multiple virtual networks on a single physical network infrastructure, improving flexibility, scalability, and security"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network sniffing attack?",
      "answer": "An unauthorized attempt to capture and analyze network traffic, usually for the purpose of stealing sensitive information or launching other attacks"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a static IP address and a dynamic IP address?",
      "answer": "A static IP address is manually assigned and remains constant, while a dynamic IP address is automatically assigned by a DHCP server and may change over time"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network bridge?",
      "answer": "A device or software that connects multiple network segments or LANs, forwarding data between them and ensuring seamless communication"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a router table?",
